# Course Section 1

## Testing Functional Code

**In File:** `test/Simple.test.ts`

* [ ] Validate environment
  * [ ] Run the test
  * [ ] Fix the test

**In File:** `test/TrigMath.test.ts`

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to look at getting high test coverage over existing, working code.  
We are going to start with code that is simpler to test, so you can figure out what it does by running it, and then preserving its behavior with tests.

* [ ] Run first test
  * Confirmation: See failure message
* [ ] Get the test to pass
  * Confirmation: See green result
* [ ] Test Asin() completely - Via Debug
  * [ ] Write a new test for Asin()
  * [ ] Check coverage of Asin() with break points
    * [ ] Add a breakpoint on every line of Asin()
    * [ ] Remove breakpoint when hit
    * Confirmation: No more breakpoints in Asin()
* [ ] Test completely - Via code coverage
  * [ ] Run test coverage
     * Confirmation: See what areas of TrigMath.cpp are green (covered)
     * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the Asin() method
* [ ] Test TrigMath completely
  * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the code
  * Code Coverage reached: ______%
* [ ] Explanations and Retrospective

## Logging Behavior
